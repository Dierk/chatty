chatty
======

chatty - a chat demo that evaluates several technologies (and hopefully shows best practices)

This project is at a very, very early stage, please stay tuned.
Currently I am planning to use
* RESTful Hypermedia API
 * [HAL] (http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) or
 * [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren)
* Async Pub/Sub
 * [Atmosphere] (https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere)
* Jersey (JAX-RS reference implementation)
* JUnit
* Mockito
* Gradle Build
